            <h3>Software Developer - ExxonMobil</h3>
            <h4>May 2018 - April 2021 (3 years)</h4>

            <p>I design, develop and deliver several solutions in the enterprise and cyber security space.
            Led the design and development of a SAST (static application security testing) tool that leverages
            different open-source components to scan source code in several programming languages to find
            security issues, provide suggested solutions and enable DevSecOps.
            This application has been written in C# (.NET Core and 5) and Golang. It has been designed and
            delivered with a distributed and cloud native architecture that includes web APIs, worker services, a
            document database and a CLI tool. Some of the technologies I have used include Azure, Mongo DB,
            App Services, Function Apps, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Docker and security specifications such
            as OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect.
            Still in cyber security, I have designed and developed a web application for Threat Modeling which
            enables different teams to learn about security requirements and start implementing those in the earlier
            stages of software development.
            This application has been created using C#, .NET 5 and Blazor Server. It is cloud native, scalable and
            provides integrations with IDEs and CI pipelines.
            Created a desktop application to monitor USB posts and automatically scan all files when a storage
            device is plugged in. This desktop app was created with C# and .NET Core 3.1. It was built, tested, and
            packaged in Azure DevOps pipelines and sent to App Center for distribution to the clients.
            Also created several other apps using Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift.
            Developed a frontend Angular app and an Azure DevOps (VSTS) extension using TypeScript.
            Led the implementation of modern authentication protocols in our applications, such as OpenID
            Connect and OAuth2.
            Presented about software security development tools and modern authentication protocols in Bangkok
            and Buenos Aires.
