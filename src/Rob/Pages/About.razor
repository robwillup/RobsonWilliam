                of computation and programming, and therefore produce higher-quality solutions.

            <h3>Software Developer - ExxonMobil</h3>
            <h5>May 2018 - April 2021 (3 years)</h5>

            <p>
                    Responsible for designing, developing and delivering several solutions in the enterprise 
                and cyber security space.
                <br>
                <br>
                I led the design and development of a SAST (static application security testing) tool that 
                leverages different open-source components to scan source code in several programming 
                languages to find security issues, provide suggested solutions and enable DevSecOps.
                <br>
                This application has been written in <strong>Golang</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> (.NET Core and 5). 
                <br>
                It has been designed and delivered with a distributed and cloud native architecture that 
                includes web APIs, worker services, a document database and a CLI tool. 
                Some of the technologies I have used include Azure, Mongo DB, App Services, Function Apps, 
                GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Docker and security specifications such as OAuth 2 and 
                OpenID Connect.
                <br>
                Still in cyber security, I have designed and developed a web application for 
                Threat Modeling which enables different teams to learn about security requirements 
                and start implementing those in the earlier stages of software development.
                <br>
                This application has been created using C#, .NET 5 and Blazor Server. It is cloud 
                native, scalable and provides integrations with IDEs and CI pipelines.
                <br>
                <br>

                Created a desktop application to monitor USB posts and automatically scan all files 
                when a storage device is plugged in. 
                <br>
                This desktop app was created with C# and .NET Core 3.1. It was built, tested, and
                packaged in Azure DevOps pipelines and sent to App Center for distribution to the 
                clients.
                <br>
                <br>

                Also created several other apps using Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift.
                Developed a frontend Angular app and an Azure DevOps (VSTS) extension using 
                TypeScript. 
                <br>
                Led the implementation of modern authentication protocols in our applications, 
                such as OpenID Connect and OAuth2.
                <br>
                Presented about software security development tools and modern authentication protocols in Bangkok
                and Buenos Aires.

                There are many reliable resources available for anyone to learn more about Him,
                but the first one I would recommend you is the Holy Scriptures.
                <br>
                Again, there are several versions available, this is one of them: <a href="https://www.esv.org/">English Standard Version</a>.
                <br>
                These are other precious resources to help you in your journey with God:
