# In Jesus we live

This is the source code for the website [injesuswelive.org](https://www.injesuswelive.com).

It's built with [Blazor WASM](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) app.

The content for the pages comes from another GitHub public repository. The Blazor web app
calls GitHub's REST API to get the raw document and then renders its Markdown as HTML.
