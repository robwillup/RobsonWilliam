# Robson William's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website ([www.robwillup.com](https://www.robwillup.com)).

The website is a [Blazor WASM](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) app.

## Blog section

The blog section of my website is a technical journaling of topics I'm learning related to
software engineering, computer science and coding in general.

The content for the blog comes from another GitHub repository I have. The Blazor web app
calls GitHub's REST API to get the raw document and then renders its Markdown as HTML.
